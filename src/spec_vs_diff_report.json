  "summary": "Diff updates backend/frontend code and rollout documentation (notably App.tsx router-level error handling and a Rollout 21.7 smoke test checklist doc), but does not include evidence of executing the canister upgrade, running the smoke test end-to-end, or recording smoke test results in the required results file. It also introduces additional rollout-step content for 21.1–21.2 that was not requested for Rollout 21.7.",

      "requirement": "Produce the next build and deploy it via a canister upgrade for Rollout 21.7, keeping all existing canister state intact, and ensure the build/deploy pipeline completes successfully (no “Unable to create your app” failure).",
      "reason": "The diff shows code/doc changes but no evidence of build artifacts, deployment pipeline configuration/output, or any explicit canister-upgrade/state-preservation work/results. From the diff alone, the build+upgrade completion and state preservation cannot be verified.",

      "reason": "`frontend/UPGRADE_LINKING_VERIFICATION_RESULTS.md` is not shown as modified in the diff summary, so the required results section completion (environment fields, principals, pass/fail, failure notes) is missing from the provided changes.",
