  "summary": "Step 10 smoke test checklist file was added and ROLLOUT_STEPS.md was updated to include a Step 10 section with references to the new checklist. However, the diff evidence does not show the required \"Next Step to Execute\" section being advanced, and the smoke-test checklist evidence is truncated before confirming full coverage (all five routes + opening Edit Links dialog for both roles). Additionally, unrequested metadata/state files were modified.",

      "requirement": "Update `frontend/ROLLOUT_STEPS.md` so the \"Next Step to Execute\" section advances from Step 9.5 to Step 10 (Deployment and Launch), with clear English instructions and references to relevant checklists/log templates.",
      "reason": "The provided excerpt of `frontend/ROLLOUT_STEPS.md` shows a \"Remaining Steps\" section with \"Step 10 — Deployment and Launch\" and references, but it does not show any \"Next Step to Execute\" section or explicit advancement of that section from Step 9.5 to Step 10. With truncated content, this specific required section/wording cannot be verified.",

      "reason": "The new checklist file exists and includes fields to record principals and entity IDs, and it includes at least some route coverage (membership, publishing, release). But the file content is truncated before confirming it covers all five portal detail routes and explicitly includes steps to open the \"Edit Links\" dialog on each detail page for both roles (admin + non-admin member). The visible steps mention \"Edit Links\" button visibility, not dialog opening, and only show admin route testing section in the excerpt.",
